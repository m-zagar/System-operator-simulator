# System operator simulator
A project for the "Modelling of processing information systems" course. (Undergraduate University Study of Computing)

The goal of the project was to simulate a control center for a virtual power grid, using proper guidelines and various specific system information.

The idea was to construct a UI suitable for controlling various system processes and information (making sure that all the guidelines for the specific system were followed), as well as the ability for the user to check the status of each single system and/or part.

The application was entirely written in Java and some supporting libraries using Eclipse IDE.
